# 13C-heritability
Repository for R code and data files used for publication "Heritability of the structures and 13C fractionation in leaf wax alkanes: a model system using interfertile Solanum species" are stored here.

"d13C_uncertainty.xlsx" is an Excel spreadsheet containing carbon isotope data and propagated uncertainty, after Polissar and D'Andrea (2014).

Folder descriptions:
